# Homework1
Due Wednesday on August 29 by 11:59pm

Use the following link to to create your private github repository for this assignment. 
The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code, test cases, and input files.

In this homework, you will practice the following:
- Java data types and expressions
- Using classes Scanner, Math, Random and String
- Using conditionals and loops
- Using IntelliJ and Github

Fill in code in classes MathUtil (I recommend doing it first) and UsernameHelper. Please read comments above each method. 
Javadoc documentation is also available in the doc folder.

Do not modify the starter code except where the comments explicitly tell you to add your own code.
