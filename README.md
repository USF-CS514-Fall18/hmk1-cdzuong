# Homework1
Due Wednesday on August 29 by 11:59pm

Use the following link to to create your private github repository for this assignment: 
[homework1](https://classroom.github.com/a/ddRXr15n)

The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code, test cases, and input files.

In this homework, you will practice the following:
- Java data types and expressions
- Using classes Scanner, Math, Random and String
- Using conditionals and loops
- Using IntelliJ and Github

Fill in code in classes MathUtil (I recommend doing it first) and UsernameHelper. Please read comments above each method. 
Javadoc documentation is also available in the doc folder.

Do not modify the starter code except where the comments explicitly tell you to add your own code.

# Getting Started
We will be using IntelliJ and Github in cs514. IntelliJ is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDE is a piece of software that makes developing code easier: it contains an editor that provides clever code completion, a debugger, refactoring tools, and build automation tools.

Download [IntelliJ here]https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Select the Community edition (it's free).
Download Java 8 here You need the JDK (Java SE Development Kit).
Make sure IntelliJ is configured correctly to use Java 8.
Github is a web-based version control system. All assignments in cs514 will be posted and submitted using github. Create a github user account if you do not already have one and sign up for the Student Developer Pack.

Now you can clone the starter code from github repo and open it in IntelliJ. In the top menu choose VCS, then choose Checkout from Version Control, then choose Github and follow instructions. Here is a video that shows you how to clone a github repository  (create a copy of it on your local machine)  in IntelliJ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRKrzN0LwUw 
Once you clone the skeleton code to IntelliJ, you can fill in the code in the provided Java classes and run each class to test if your methods work correctly. Once you complete some methods, you need to commit your changes and push them to your github repository by the deadline. I recommend commiting and pushing frequently.
Please note that unless the code is in your github repo by the deadline, you will not be able to get any credit for it.

# Academic Dishonesty
Any work you submit is expected to be your own original work. You will get a 0 on the assignment if you copy & modify code from the web, or if your solution is similar to that of any other student.
